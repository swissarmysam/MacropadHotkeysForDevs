# MacropadHotkeysForDevs

A modified version of [AppPad by kbaskett248](https://github.com/kbaskett248/adafruit_MacroPad) - thanks for your awesome work!

## How it differs
- Windows OS only
- Home is now app switcher for quick access to core apps

### Notes
- Last key on first row is always double-tap to go back
- Home.py is where you can change which apps appear on the starting page

# App Macros
1. Windows General - general windows shortcuts like snip tool, tab switching etc (color picker requires [PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/))
2. Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge) - dev-centric shortcuts with a focus on dev tools
3. Firefox - dev-centric shortcuts with a focus on dev tools

5. Visual Studio - shortcuts for searching, toggling comments, breakpoints and solutions
6. Git commands - quick access to most commonly used commands
7. Terminal commands - Azure, Powershell, nav and npm commands
8. Function keys - double tap will give you more eg. double tap F1 will be F13
